1. Generating dataset
	* Put all the negaive and positive images in the "/dataset/Training_data/" directory
	* Rename Image: 	for positive - positive.{index no. eg. 1,2,3..}.jpg or jpeg
							for negative - negative.{index no. eg. 1,2,3..}.jpg or jpeg
							if they are in "PNG" format convert them in jpg format using "png_to_jpg.py" code and set the path accoringly

2. Training 
	* Train CNN model on the generated dataset using "trainModel.py" code(Set the no. of epochs based on total_loss value using hit and trial)
	* Trained model will be saved in "/home/ashish/Anomoly-detection/Image-forgery-detection/model/" directory

3. Testing
	* save all the test Images in "/home/ashish/Anomoly-detection/Image-forgery-detection/dataset/Testdataset" directory
	* Run "runTest.py" code

Note: for better accuracy use dataset equally or nearly equally divided in negative and positive images
